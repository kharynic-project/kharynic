# Grim and mature story
Story takes place in remote fortress in the mountains. Once it served as high security prison for violent insane criminals and traitors of the crown. Years ago the realm was conquered by expanding rogue kingdom, being just one of many on bloody tyrants path to rule the whole continent. Cells are getting more and more crowded, as new king sends here everyone suspected of opposing his iron hand rules and next bloody conquests. Prisoners start getting forced to work building new, large ring of fortifications around the fortress and large wooden baracks with prison cells inside. Rumors say that king is going to use them to revive old mines in the area, as his ever-growing army is in constant need of swords and armor.

# Status
Project is in very early stage. Currently scripting and game editing system is being developed. Efforts are focused on making further development easier for people with no expierience in software development. Roadmap with current status can be found in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).
