<title>Kharynic - dev preview</title>
Preview of other development branches is not ready yet. <br>
It is going to be available after basic game editing tools are ready. <br>
Stay tuned - announcement will be made after release of scripting api and runtime resource loaders.<br>
Estimated time: 2nd quarter 2018.<br>
<br>
In order to use this functionality, you are going to need public fork of github.com/kharynic-project/kharynic with GitHub Pages enabled (master branch, default domain). <br>
IFrame on this site will load sandboxed game resources from {user}.github.io/Kharynic, where {user} is taken from url parameter: kharynic.org/dev?{user}. <br>
If you're using custom GitHub Pages domain and still want to use this functionality, feel free to implement workaround based on GitHub API.
