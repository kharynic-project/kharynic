We are rebooting the project on modern Unity Engine on the web platform. 
Entering game website is enough to play it. It will load from the server in the background. 
At some point HTML GUI will be smoothly replaced by in-game one.
You will be able to start playing at some point, while it will still be downloading rest of the assets.
Once it's done, it will notify you that now it's accessible offline in the cache of your browser.
You can bookmark it, add desktop shortcut to it or even download it to specific place on your hard drive.
