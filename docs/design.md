Inspiration for this game was unfinished fan-made prequel of game Gothic I from Piranha Bytes.
Guy whom I recruited caused breakup of the team, taking many with him. Old project director was forced to resign.
Together with those still working with me I abandoned old immature amateurish screenplay, limited engine older than some of us and equally outdatd modkit and assets.
